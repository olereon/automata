# Playwright MCP Server Test Plan

## Test Objectives

This test plan outlines comprehensive testing scenarios for the Playwright MCP server implementation to ensure it works correctly on both Linux and Windows platforms.

## Potential Issues Identified

Based on analysis of the codebase, here are 5-7 potential sources of problems:

1. **Cross-Platform Browser Path Issues**: The code includes platform-specific browser executable paths that may not be correctly configured on Windows vs Linux
2. **WebSocket Connection Handling**: The MCP server relies on WebSocket connections that may behave differently across platforms
3. **Async/Await Pattern Inconsistencies**: The code uses extensive async/await patterns that may have platform-specific timing issues
4. **Browser Context and Page Management**: Multiple browser contexts and pages may not be properly cleaned up on all platforms
5. **JSON Command Parsing and Validation**: The command parser uses JSON schema validation that may have platform-specific quirks
6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Error handling mechanisms may not work consistently across platforms
7. **Memory and Resource Management**: Browser automation may leak resources differently on Windows vs Linux

After analysis, the 1-2 most likely sources of problems are:
1. **Cross-Platform Browser Path Issues**: This is critical because the code explicitly handles Windows and Linux executable paths differently
2. **WebSocket Connection Handling**: WebSocket connections are fundamental to the MCP server and may have platform-specific behaviors

## Test Scenarios

### 2. JSON Command Parsing and Validation Tests

#### 2.1 Valid Command Parsing
- **Test Case**: Send valid JSON commands for all supported command types
- **Expected Result**: Commands are parsed and executed successfully
- **Logging**: Log received commands, parsing results, and execution status

#### 2.2 Invalid Command Handling
- **Test Case**: Send invalid JSON commands (malformed JSON, missing required fields, invalid values)
- **Expected Result**: Appropriate error responses with validation details
- **Logging**: Log invalid commands and error responses

#### 2.3 Command Schema Validation
- **Test Case**: Test commands with edge case values (boundary values, special characters)
- **Expected Result**: Schema validation correctly handles edge cases
- **Logging**: Log schema validation results for edge cases

### 3. Browser Automation Tests

#### 3.1 Navigation Commands
- **Test Case**: Navigate to various URLs (HTTP, HTTPS, different domains)
- **Expected Result**: Browser navigates successfully and loads pages
- **Logging**: Log navigation requests, URLs, and load status

#### 3.2 Element Interaction Commands
- **Test Case**: Click, type, hover on various elements using different selectors (CSS, XPath, text)
- **Expected Result**: Elements are interacted with successfully
- **Logging**: Log element selectors, interaction attempts, and results

#### 3.3 Waiting Strategies
- **Test Case**: Test different wait conditions (time-based, element visibility, text presence)
- **Expected Result**: Wait conditions are handled correctly
- **Logging**: Log wait conditions, timeouts, and results

#### 3.4 Screenshot Commands
- **Test Case**: Take screenshots of pages and specific elements
- **Expected Result**: Screenshots are captured and saved/returned correctly
- **Logging**: Log screenshot requests, paths, and success/failure

### 4. Cross-Platform Compatibility Tests

#### 4.1 Browser Executable Path Detection
- **Test Case**: Test browser startup with default and custom executable paths
- **Expected Result**: Browser starts correctly on both Windows and Linux
- **Logging**: Log browser executable paths and startup success/failure

#### 4.2 Platform-Specific Configuration
- **Test Case**: Test platform-specific settings (temp directories, paths)
- **Expected Result**: Platform-specific configurations are applied correctly
- **Logging**: Log platform detection and configuration settings

#### 4.3 File Path Handling
- **Test Case**: Test file operations with different path formats (Windows backslashes, Linux forward slashes)
- **Expected Result**: File paths are handled correctly on both platforms
- **Logging**: Log file path operations and normalization

### 5. Error Handling and Logging Tests

#### 5.1 Browser Error Handling
- **Test Case**: Trigger browser errors (invalid URLs, non-existent elements)
- **Expected Result**: Errors are caught and handled gracefully with informative messages
- **Logging**: Log browser errors, stack traces, and error handling actions

#### 5.2 Connection Error Handling
- **Test Case**: Test connection failures (invalid URLs, unreachable servers)
- **Expected Result**: Connection errors are handled with appropriate retries and fallbacks
- **Logging**: Log connection attempts, failures, and retry actions

#### 5.3 Resource Cleanup
- **Test Case**: Test resource cleanup after errors (browser contexts, pages, connections)
- **Expected Result**: Resources are properly cleaned up even after errors
- **Logging**: Log resource cleanup actions and success/failure

### 6. Performance and Load Tests

#### 6.1 Concurrent Connections
